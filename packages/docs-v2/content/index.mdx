# Zodiac Roles Modifier

Zodiac Roles Modifier is an onchain permissions module for smart accounts. With Roles, onchain entities can extend secure transaction permissions to any address through flexible, customizable roles — implementable on nearly any existing onchain system. The smart contract module attaches to any avatar (a Safe or other web3 account), enabling onchain entities of all sizes to tailor roles and permissions to their needs, ensuring robust, secure, and seamless web3 transactions.

## Overview

- **Zodiac Roles Modifier:** A smart contract module that allows onchain entities to create roles with granular permissions and grant them to any address.
- **Zodiac Roles Toolkit:** An accompanying kit for developers to make building with Roles more powerful and interacting with it simpler.
  - **App:** A web app for navigating your roles and permissions
  - **SDK:** A TypeScript software development kit to programmatically manage roles and permissions
  - **Starter Kit:** A [template project](https://github.com/gnosisguild/permissions-starter-kit) to help developers get started managing [permissions as code](https://engineering.gnosisguild.org/posts/permissions-as-code)
  - **Subgraph:** A specialized querying tool to easily explore roles and permissions associated with any Zodiac Roles Modifier

<Callout type="info">
  Zodiac Roles Modifier is designed to work seamlessly with [Zodiac
  Pilot](https://pilot.gnosisguild.org/), a new paradigm in wallet-dapp
  interaction that allows authorized roles to easily craft multi-send batch
  transactions on behalf of an onchain entity through a simple interface.

## Core Benefits

- **Role-Based Access Control:** Extends onchain permissions beyond owners/signers, allowing professionals like treasury managers to efficiently manage an org’s critical functions
- **Streamlined Transaction Execution:** Enables permissioned transactions with clear parameters, eliminating the need for Safe owners/signers to approve every transaction
- **Hyper Compatibility:** Allows onchain entities to implement nearly any access control pattern on top of nearly any existing onchain system
- **Robust Security:** Ensures secure transaction environments through meticulous permission scoping and access control safeguards
- **Efficient Role Management:** Simplifies and streamlines user management tasks and transaction permissions

## Key Features

- **Create & Assign Roles:** Generate custom roles and assign them to any address
- **Fine-Tune Permissions:** Assign granular permissions to each role, scoping authorized addresses, designated functions, and allowed parameter values through a highly expressive conditions system
- **Set Rate and Threshold Limits:** Set limits on how frequently a given role or permission can be used, along with thresholds for the scoped parameters granted by a given permission
- **Execute Secure Transactions:** Authorize role members to perform secure transactions on behalf of the avatar (e.g. a Safe or other compatible smart account)
- **Manage Roles & Permissions:** Manage roles and query permissions using the TypeScript SDK and integrated subgraph
