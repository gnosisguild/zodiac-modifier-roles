# Architecture

The SDK is designed in three layers of abstraction:

## Layer 1: Targets

This layer has diffing & patching functions on role configurations, operating on JSON objects matching the `Role` type of the subgraph schema.

**Example:**

```typescript
{
  address: "0x182B723a58739a9c974cFDB385ceaDb237453c28",
  clearance: Clearance.Function,
  functions: [
    {
      selector: "0x84e9bd7e",
      condition: {
        paramType: AbiType.AbiEncoded,
        operator: Operator.Matches,
        children: [
          {
            paramType: AbiType.Static,
            operator: Operator.EqualTo,
            compValue: defaultAbiCoder.encode(["address"], ["0x4F2083f5fBede34C2714aFfb3105539775f7FE64"]),
          }
        ],
      },
    }
  ]
}
```

**Functions implemented on this layer:**

- fetch current role configurations
- compute contract calls required for patching an existing role configuration (targets and members) to a desired configuration
- integrity checks, minimizations, and normalizations for conditions

## Layer 2: Permissions

For authoring purposes it is useful to capture permissions in a slightly different structure:
Rather than the list of targets with nested functions as exposed by the subgraph, permissions are defined by a flat array of entries that grant call right to an address or a specific function at an address.

This layer also provides [condition helper functions](/sdk/conditions#condition-functions) for a more convenient way of expressing conditions.

**Example:**

```typescript
{
  targetAddress: '0x182B723a58739a9c974cFDB385ceaDb237453c28',
  signature: "claim_rewards(address)",
  condition: c.calldataMatches([c.avatar], ["address"]),
}
```

**Functions implemented on this layer:**

- support for condition authoring
- joining permissions addressing the same function

## <a name="kits"></a>Layer 3: Kits

On the highest layer of abstraction, users can generate _kits_ for contracts they want to define permission for.
A kit is a typed SDK tailored to a specific set of contracts that allows defining permissions on these in a convenient syntax and fully supported by the type system.

Users just provide the addresses of contracts. Powered by [eth-sdk](https://github.com/gnosisguild/eth-sdk) and [TypeChain](https://github.com/gnosisguild/TypeChain), ABIs will be automatically downloaded from Etherscan to generate type-safe functions for granting permissions.

**Example:**

```typescript
allow.curve.stETH_ETH_gauge["claim_rewards(address)"](c.avatar);
```

**Functions implemented on this layer:**

- type system support for conditions authoring
