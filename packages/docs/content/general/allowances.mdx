# Allowances

Allowances serve as a mechanism for enforcing spending limits or other types of quotas for individual roles.

## Structure

Allowances are centrally defined and can be referenced from conditions.

Each allowance is stored as a tuple of the following shape:

```solidity
struct Allowance {
  uint128 refill;
  uint128 maxRefill;
  uint64 period;
  uint128 balance;
  uint64 timestamp;
}
```

`period` – Duration of the refill interval in seconds, 0 for one-time allowance

`refill` – Amount that will be refilled per interval

`timestamp` – Timestamp of the last interval refilled for

`maxRefill` – Max accrual amount, refilling stops once the unused allowance balance hits this value

`balance` – Unused allowance that can be spent

All fields can be manually updated.

Upon consumption of an allowance, the `balance` and `timestamp` fields will automatically:

- Update the balance to reflect the accrual since the last refill
- Update the refill timestamp to the current interval's timestamp
- Subtract the consumed amount from the balance

## Usage

There are three different ways allowances can be used:

### Allowance on a `uint` field

To define an allowance on any `uint` field in the transaction calldata, use a [`WithinAllowance`](/general/conditions#withinallowance) condition.

### Allowance on the Ether `value`

To define an allowance on the Ether `value` sent with the transaction, use an [`EtherWithinAllowance`](/general/conditions#etherwithinallowance) condition.

### Call Rate Limits

To enforce a rate limit on the number of calls to a function, use a [`CallWithinAllowance`](/general/conditions#callwithinallowance) condition. Each call to the function will decrement the allowance balance by `1`.
