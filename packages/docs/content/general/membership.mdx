# Membership

Roles are granted to members — addresses that are allowed to execute transactions through the Roles Modifier on behalf of the controlled account.
Each membership links an address to a specific role and can optionally be constrained by time bounds and usage limits.

## Granting Roles

The owner grants a role to an address by creating a membership.
A membership associates a member address with a role and defines the terms under which the member may use it.

## Time-Bound Memberships

Memberships can optionally specify start and end timestamps:

- **start** — The earliest point in time at which the membership becomes active. Before this timestamp, the member cannot execute transactions under this role.
- **end** — The point in time at which the membership expires. After this timestamp, the member can no longer use the role.

If no timestamps are set, the membership is active indefinitely (until explicitly revoked).

## Usage-Limited Memberships

Memberships can optionally cap the number of times a member may execute transactions under a role:

- By default, memberships allow unlimited uses.
- When a use count is configured, each successful execution decrements the remaining count.
- Once the count reaches zero, the membership is effectively exhausted and the member can no longer execute transactions under that role.

## Automatic Expiry

A membership automatically becomes inactive when either condition is met:

- The current time is past the configured **end** timestamp.
- The configured use count has been fully consumed.

No explicit revocation transaction is needed — the Roles Modifier enforces these constraints at execution time.

## Self-Revocation

A member can revoke their own role at any time.
This is useful in scenarios where a member's key may have been compromised: the member can immediately remove access without waiting for the owner to act.
