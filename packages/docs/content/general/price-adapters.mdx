# Price Adapters

Price adapters provide on-chain price conversion, enabling the Roles Modifier to reason about values across different token denominations.

## Use Cases

### Denominated Allowances

[Allowances](/general/allowances) track spending limits as raw token amounts.
When a role needs a unified spending cap across multiple tokens (for example, a USD-denominated budget that applies to both USDC and WETH transfers), a price adapter converts each token amount into the shared denomination before checking and consuming the allowance.

This makes it possible to define a single allowance that covers transactions involving different assets, without requiring a separate allowance for each token.

### Ratio Validation and Slippage Protection

Price adapters also support the [`WithinRatio`](/general/conditions#withinratio) condition operator.
This operator compares two values (for example, the input and output amounts of a swap) and checks that their ratio falls within an acceptable range.

By consulting a price adapter, `WithinRatio` can normalize the two amounts to a common unit before comparing them.
This enables slippage protection: a condition can enforce that the value received from a swap is within a specified percentage of the value sent.

## How It Works

A price adapter is a contract that exposes a price conversion interface.
When the Roles Modifier encounters a condition that requires price conversion, it calls the configured price adapter to translate the value in scope to the target denomination.

The adapter is responsible for sourcing the exchange rate — typically from an on-chain oracle — and returning the converted amount.
Different adapter implementations can integrate with different oracle systems (e.g., Chainlink, Uniswap TWAP) depending on the requirements of the deployment.
