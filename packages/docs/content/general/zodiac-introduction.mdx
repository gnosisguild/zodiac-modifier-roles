# Zodiac Introduction

[Zodiac](https://github.com/gnosisguild/zodiac) is a composable design framework for DAOs, built on an open standard.
It provides a collection of tools that enable flexible, modular control of programmable blockchain accounts.
The framework is unopinionated — it defines interfaces rather than prescribing specific governance patterns, so different tools can be freely combined.

## Building Blocks

### Avatars

An avatar is a programmable Ethereum account that holds assets and executes transactions.
The most common example is a [Safe](https://safe.global/) multisig.
Avatars implement the `IAvatar` interface, making them compatible with any Zodiac module or modifier.

### Modules

A module is a contract that implements decision-making logic and is enabled on an avatar.
Modules translate governance decisions into on-chain actions — for example, a module might allow on-chain voting results to trigger transactions on the avatar.

### Modifiers

A modifier sits between a module and an avatar, altering how the module's transactions reach the avatar.
Modifiers themselves expose the `IAvatar` interface, so modules interact with them as if they were the avatar directly.
This makes modifiers composable: they can be chained together, each adding its own constraints before forwarding calls to the next.

The **Roles Modifier** is an example of this pattern.
It interposes a permission layer: only transactions that match the permissions granted to the caller's role are forwarded to the avatar.

## Key Properties of the Roles Modifier

Every Roles Modifier instance is configured with three addresses:

- **owner** — The address that can configure roles, permissions, and memberships. Typically a multisig or governance contract.
- **avatar** — The smart account (e.g., a Safe) whose assets are controlled. Calls that pass permission checks are executed on behalf of this account.
- **target** — The contract that calls are forwarded to. Usually `target === avatar`, but they can differ when chaining the Roles Modifier with other Zodiac modifiers.
