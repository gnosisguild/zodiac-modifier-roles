# Transaction Unwrapping

In certain scenarios, the raw transaction data might not lend itself to be checked against the configured role permissions directly. 
An example are batch transactions through the [MultiSend contract](https://github.com/safe-global/safe-smart-account/blob/main/contracts/libraries/MultiSendCallOnly.sol).
Instead of scoping the data encoding the full batch of transactions, permissions should be checked individually for each call in the batch.

Transaction unwrapping can be configured as a pre-processing step to be applied for specific target addresses.
The unwrapping logic is implemented in adapter contracts.

## `MultiSendUnwrapper`

The `MultiSendUnwrapper` adapter contract at the official deployment address `0x93B7fCbc63ED8a3a24B59e1C3e6649D50B7427c0` can be used to support unwrapping of batch transaction through the [MultiSend contract](https://github.com/safe-global/safe-smart-account/blob/main/contracts/libraries/MultiSendCallOnly.sol).

To enable multi-send unwrapping call the `setTransactionUnwrapper` function as the owner of the Roles mod:

```solidity
rolesMod.setTransactionUnwrapper(
    address(0x9641d764fc13c8B624c04430C7356C1C7C8102e2)),  // offical MultiSendCallOnly deployment on mainnet
    bytes4(keccak256('multiSend(bytes)'),  // multiSend function selectot
    address(0x93B7fCbc63ED8a3a24B59e1C3e6649D50B7427c0)  // address of the MultiSendUnwrapper
)
```

Addresses of the official MultiSend deployments on all chains are listed at https://github.com/safe-global/safe-deployments.

## Custom unwrappers

Custom transaction unwrapping logic can be implemented as contracts conforming to the `ITransactionUnwrapper` interface.

```solidity
interface ITransactionUnwrapper {
    function unwrap(
        address to,
        uint256 value,
        bytes calldata data,
        Enum.Operation operation
    ) external view returns (UnwrappedTransaction[] memory result);
}
```
