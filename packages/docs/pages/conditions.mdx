# Conditions

Zodiac Roles implements a condition system that allows for defining complex conditions over call data and ether value.

A condition is represented by a tree structure.
Each node in the tree defines a condition operator and informs the call data range it targets.
The root node of the tree generally targets the entire call data range, while children condition nodes allow setting conditions on specific fields of the decoded call data.

## Node Properties

Each condition node is defined by the following properties:

### `paramType`

Informs how to pluck to value from call data. Can be one of the following:

**`AbiEncoded`** – Decode the value using standard ABI decoding. The `children` condition nodes inform the individual field types.

**`Static`** – Interpret the word currently in scope as a static value, i.e., a value with a fixed length padded to 32 bytes.

**`Dynamic`** – Interpret the word currently in scope as an offset to a dynamic length value, i.e., `bytes` or `string`.

**`Tuple`** – Decode the value as a tuple. The `children` condition nodes inform the types of the tuple's fields.

**`Array`** – Interpret the word as an offset to an dynamic length array. The `children` condition nodes inform the array element type.

### `children`

An array of sub conditions, used for any of the following purposes:

- Inform the decoding of complex types by defining types of their fields or elements (required for `ParamType.AbiEncoded`, `ParamType.Tuple`, `ParamType.Array`)
- Set conditions on specific fields of a tuple type value (via `Operator.Matches`)
- Set conditions on elements of an array type value (via `Operator.ArraySome`, `Operator.ArrayEvery`, `Operator.ArraySubset`)
- Define branch conditions for n-ary logical operators (`Operator.And`, `Operator.Or`, `Operator.Nor`)

### `operator`

Defines the conditional operation to apply to the value plucked from call data.
Check out the [Operators](#operators) section for a list of all available operators.

### `compValue`

Only used with comparison operators. Defines the value to compare against.

## Operators

### `EqualTo`

Checks equality of the plucked value to a given comparison value.

### `EqualToAvatar`

This is equivalent to using `EqualTo` with the avatar address as `compValue`.
Since this is a commonly used comparison, this extra operator is provided for convenience and optimization purposes.
The avatar address is available to the condition evaluation function and thus does not need to be stored as a comparison value.

### `Pass`

Allows any value. Used for condition nodes that are required solely for informing how to decode complex type value.
For example, the types of all fields of a tuple must be defined so that the tuple can be correctly decoded.

## Examples

### Balancer swap

The following condition enforces that the Balancer [single swap](https://docs.balancer.fi/reference/swaps/single-swap.html#single-swap) function must only be used to swap WETH for DAI and vice versa.
Also, sender and recipient for the swap must be set to the avatar address.

<BalancerSwapExample />

The root condition node generally targets the entire call data range after the 4 bytes function selector.
It uses `ParamType.AbiEncoded` for defining how to decode the bytes in that range.

We define `Operator.Matches` checks on both tuples. For `singleSwap` we require an exact match on the `poolId` fields.
For the `assetIn` and `assetOut` fields we require the values to be either `WETH` or `DAI` using `Operator.Or`.

For `swapInfo` we require the `sender` and `recipient` fields to be set to the address of the avatar using `Operator.EqualToAvatar`.

This example shows `Operator.Matches` being used to set conditions on specific fields of a tuple type value.
