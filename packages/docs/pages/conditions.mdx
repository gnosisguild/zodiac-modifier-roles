# Conditions

Zodiac Roles implements a condition system that allows for defining complex conditions over call data and ether value.

## Conditions Tree Structure

A condition is represented by a tree structure.
Each node in the tree defines a condition operator and informs the call data range it targets.
The root node of the tree generally targets the entire call data range, while children condition nodes allow setting conditions on specific fields of the decoded call data.

### Node Properties

Each condition node is defined by the following properties:

#### `paramType`

Informs how to pluck to value from call data. Can be one of the following:

`AbiEncoded` â€“ Decode the call data using standard ABI decoding. The `children` condition nodes inform the individual field types.

#### `children`

An array of sub conditions, used for any of the following purposes:

- Inform the decoding of complex types by defining types for each of their fields (required for `ParamType.AbiEncoded`, `ParamType.Tuple`, `ParamType.Array`)
- Set conditions on specific fields of a tuple type value (via `Operator.Matches`)
- Set conditions on elements of an array type value (via `Operator.ArraySome`, `Operator.ArrayEvery`, `Operator.ArraySubset`)
- Define sub conditions for n-ary operators (`And`, `Or`, `Nor`)

#### `operator`

Defines the conditional operation to apply to the value plucked from call data.

#### `compValue`

Only used with comparison operators. Defines the value to compare against.

### Examples

#### Balancer swap

The following condition enforces that the Balancer [single swap](https://docs.balancer.fi/reference/swaps/single-swap.html#single-swap) function must only be used to swap WETH for DAI and vice versa.
Also, sender and recipient for the swap must set to the avatar address.

## Operators

### `EqualTo`

Checks equality of a value with a given comparison value.

### `Pass`

Allows any value. Used for condition nodes that are required solely for informing how to decode complex type value.
For example, the types of all fields of a tuple must be defined so that the tuple can be correctly decoded.

```javascript
test;
```
